A Snakemake workflow for shipping data from the [CRC Cohort](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/scientific-collaboration/colorectal-cancer-cohort/) to a
destination approved through a successful [access request](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/services/access-policies/).

The CRC Cohort is a collection of clinical data and digital high-resolution
digital pathology images pertaining to tumor cases.  The collection has been
assembled from a number of participating biobanks and other partners through the
[ADOPT BBMRI-ERIC](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/scientific-collaboration/adopt-bbmri-eric/) project.

Researchers interested in using the data for science can file an application for
access.  If approved, the part of the dataset required for the planned and
approved work can be copied to the requester's selected secure storage location
(using this workflow).
